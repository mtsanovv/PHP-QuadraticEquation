# PHP-CLI Quadratic Equation Calculator
A simple quadratic equation calculator for real roots, written by 15 year old me (June 2016) to put my PHP OOP skills to the test.

## Requirements
 - PHP-CLI 5.5 or higher

## Instructions
You need to execute the Calculator.php file.

- Running on Windows (assuming you have the PHP-CLI exe added to the PATH variable):
```
> Calculator.php
```
- Running on Linux/Mac OS X:
```
$ php Calculator.php
```

## Notes
 - This was uploaded for archival purposes mostly to show how I did programming a long time ago, back in June 2016. It was done in a rushy way, for no more than 12 hours. The 9th grade me didn't know a lot about good practices, apparently. Back in the day I did PHP anyway.
 - There are some good practices, there are some terrible ones used in this project. This code definitely shouldn't be any reference, if you decide to use it anyway, just please, make sure to question everything you copy and check for yourself if it's okay to be used the way it is.
 - To enhance user friendliness, it is created in a way so that it represents calculations of roots of a quadratic equation, done on paper.
