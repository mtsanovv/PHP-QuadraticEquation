# PHP-CLI Quadratic Equation Calculator
A simple quadratic equation calculator for real roots, written by 9th grade me (2016) to put my PHP OOP skills to the test.

## Requirements
 - PHP-CLI 5.5 or higher

## Instructions
You need to execute the Calculator.php file.

- Running on Windows (assuming you have the PHP-CLI exe added to the PATH variable):
```
> Calculator.php
```
- Running on Linux/Mac OS X:
```
$ php Calculator.php
```

## Notes
 - This was uploaded for archival purposes mostly and to show how I did programming a long time ago, back in June 2016. It was done in a rushy way, for no more than 12 hours. The 9th grade me didn't know a lot about good practices, apparently. Back in the day I did PHP anyways.
 - To enhance user friendliness, it is created in a way so that it represents calculations of roots of a quadratic equation, done on paper.
